# KunQuant

KunQuant is a optimizer, code generator and executor for financial expressions and factors. The initial aim of it is to generate efficient implementation code for [Alpha101](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.00991) of WorldQuant. Some existing implementations of Alpha101 is straightforward but too simple. Hence we are developing KunQuant to provide optimization on a batch of general factors.
